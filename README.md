# < Dynamic-README.md-Generator >

# Motivation

As a FullStack coding student, GitHub is where I store and present all of my projects. Each project has a README.md file- meaning, I have been greating each README.md file for each project. The main motivation and purpose for this specific project was to create a dynamic and professional README.md generator for all of my future repositories. This will not only increase efficiency, but also save time and allow each REAME.md file to be clean and professional.
